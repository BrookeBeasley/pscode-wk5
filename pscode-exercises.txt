// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Begin  
WRITE “Please enter two numbers to add” 
READ num1 
READ num2 
Sum = num1+num2 
WRITE Sum 
End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Begin
WRITE "Please enter number to begin"
READ num
if num / 2 print "even"
else print "odd"
End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Begin  
WRITE “Please enter 5 nunbers” 
READ n1 
READ n2 
READ n3 
READ n4
READ n5
Sum = n1+n2+n3+n4+n5
Avg = Sum/5
WRITE "The average is"
	Write avg 

If(n1 < n2)
	Set max to n2
Else
	Set max to n1
If(n3 > max)
	Set max to n3
If(n4 > max)
	Set max to n4
If(n5 > max)
	Set max to n5
Write "The max is"
	Write max

If(n1 > n2)
	Set min to n2
Else
	Set min to n1
If(n3 < min)
	Set min to n3
If(n4 < min)
	Set min to n4
If(n5 < min)
	Set min to n5
Write "The min is"
	Write min
